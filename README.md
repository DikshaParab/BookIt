The Venue Booking System is a comprehensive database project designed to manage and optimize the booking of venues such as auditoriums, seminar halls, and meeting rooms. This project involves creating a relational database with four primary tables: User, Admin, Venue, and Booking. The system facilitates efficient data storage and retrieval to support seamless interaction between users, admins, and venues.

The User table stores details of individuals making bookings, categorized as general users or admins. The Venue table holds information about venues, including their names, locations, and capacities. The Booking table tracks all bookings, linking users to venues, with attributes such as booking dates and status (e.g., pending, confirmed, or canceled). Additionally, the Admin table manages administrators who oversee bookings and approvals.

This project incorporates complex SQL operations such as joins, subqueries, and views to provide actionable insights. Examples include identifying peak booking periods, tracking venue utilization rates, and analyzing user behavior. The database design emphasizes normalization and efficiency, ensuring data integrity and scalability.

Key outputs include interactive reports on upcoming bookings, occupancy rates, and admin activity. By leveraging SQL for data analytics, this project demonstrates the application of relational databases in real-world scenarios, enabling effective decision-making for venue management systems.
